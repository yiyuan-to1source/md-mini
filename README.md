> Minimum Material Design CSS Framework special design for AMPã€€(Accelerate Mobile Page) and PWA (Progress Web App)

This framework is based on [mini.css]() with many extensions, to create a small enough but feature rich css Framework
to fit into the AMP limitation (500kb in total size, no external link css).

The goal is to have a relatively complete Material Design framework, that can be use out of the box, and avoid secondary
development.
